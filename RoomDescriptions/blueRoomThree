You enter the room and almost slip and fall. The floor seems to be covered in intermittent patches of ice. There is shelf to your left with a steel ball sitting atop it. To your right, there is an intricate series of pipes.

#ROOM_STATE_1#

This room has an icy floor, a series of tubes, a door to the North and a shelf to your left.

The ball travels in a Rube-Goldberd-fashion through the pipes. You hear it clanking around in every direction, then hear an unlocking sound from the door to the North.
