The room around you is cavernous and large. The walls are smooth and appear to be carved precisely out of the white marble of the room you are in. They arch to meet the ceiling.
The air is stale and dry. A sense of anticipation pulses through the room. The walls are grimy and there is a something ancient and otherworldly about the room. It is an entity onto itself,
 and it engulfs whomever enters. There is a feeling of foreboding, and the vastness of the room feels constricting, like there is not place to run to or hide.
There is nothing in the room except a note at your feet and a ornate wooden chest in the middle of the room. You want to disappear, but you can't turn around.
A green light is coming from an moldy green key, that looks like it has moss all around it.
A white key shines brightly with a fire that radiates heat. You approach it cautiously, placing one index finger first, afraid it will burn.
A blue key flickers, obsfucating for a second before you see a clear outline.
You know you must pick each key up and use it on a door to your west, north, and east.
To the west there is a green door.
To east has a white door.
To the north door is blue.
