The room around you is cavernous and large. The walls are smooth and appear to be carved precisely out of the white marble of the room you are in. They arch to meet the ceiling. The air is stale and dry. A sense of anticipation pulses through the room. The walls are grimy and there is a something ancient and otherworldly about the room. It is an entity onto itself, and it engulfs whomever enters. There is a feeling of foreboding, and the vastness of the room feels constricting, like there is not place to run to or hide.
There is nothing in the room except a note at your feet and a ornate wooden chest in the middle of the room. You want to disappear, but you can't turn around. The wooden chest calls to you, and you can do nothing to stop yourself from slowly advancing. You approach the crate, and the three torches that illuminate the bare room flicker, as if on command. The room is mostly dark, but as you approach the crate, you notice that the light you thought it was reflecting, is really a light all its own. As you get closer to the crate, you notice three different lights that you hadn't seen before. There are three colors that radiate, a sickly green, a fire red, and a mesmerizing blue. You look around, but don't see the light anywhere else. As you approach the crate, you realize the lights are radiating from three keys. Each key is a a different color.
The green light is coming from an moldy green key, that looks like it has moss all around it.
The red key shines brightly with a fire that radiates heat. You approach it cautiously, placing one index finger first, afraid it will burn. You place your index finger, but instead of heat, you feel an icy chill run through your body. You pick up the key, and it feels frozen.
You pick up the key, and the fuzz of the moss irritates your skin. The smell of the key is like a dead tree, damp and rotten.
