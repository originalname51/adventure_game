You walk into the room and are shocked to be staring at yourself across the distance.
Every surface around you is smooth and mirrored.
There are two pillars in the corners of the room, one white, one black, and a rope coiled between the two.
One pillar is black, the other white.
You imagine an outline of a door to the North, but that could just be habit at this point.

The pillars have covered where the rope used to reside. Using this as a focal point, your navigation around the room is unhindered.
You see exits to the North and South.
