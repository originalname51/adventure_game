This is a green room. There is a river of poison water. You see a boat, it looks like you could *use* it to get to the other side of the river.
There is a door on the other side of the room. Underneath the door there are decorations on the ground of a fox, goose, and a bean. You feel strangely drawn to the objects.
You notice there are three medium sized tokens on the ground. The thought of picking both up at the same time immediately fills your stomach with dread. You know you must bring them to the other side of the room, but can sense leaving some tokens with each other is a bad idea (the otherside of the room has a depiction of a fox preying on a goose with a boat 1/2 way across the poison river.
#ROOM_STATE_1#
The fox, goose, and bean token sit inert, ready to be moved to the other side of the room. There is a boat that you can use, as well as a door to the west.
#ROOM_STATE_2#
The fox , goose, and bean token have succesfully been placed on the ground. You beat the puzzle. Go get a beer! Exit to the West.
