This room seems very plain. Stone floors, with walls of metal surround you. There are a series of unlit torches in front of you, but each is encased in glass. You are unsure of where the light in the room has come from. There is a door across the room, on the North wall.

#ROOM_STATE_1#

An array of torches stand before you. The cases don't look locked.

#ROOM_STATE_2#

Having taken the only available torch, this room holds little else for you apart from a flight of stairs.
