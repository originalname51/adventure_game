After coming down the stairs, you enter into a room that seems much colder than the last room you were in.
The walls are covered in glyphs that you don't recognize, apart from what appears to be a drawing of a fish.
A door is on the North wall. There is a thick and almost choking mist in the air that stirs as you move through it.
You catch a glimmer of reflection on the ceiling in front of you?
#ROOM_STATE_1#
This room is quite cold, with mist flowing through it and glyphs on the walls, with a door to the North.
#ROOM_STATE_2#
The mist having thinned, you can clearly see many of the glyphs, and your path is unobstructed to the North and South.
