After coming down the stairs, you enter into a room that seems much colder than the last room you were in. The walls are covered in glyphs that you don't recognize, apart from what appears to be a drawing of a fish. A door is on the East wall. There is a mist in the air that stirs as you move through it. You catch a glimmer of reflection on the ceiling in front of youâ€¦

This room is quite cold, with mist flowing through it and glyphs on the walls, with a door to the East.

With the torch in hand, you don't find any resistance around the East-facing door.
