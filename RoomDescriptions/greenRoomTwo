This is the second green room. It is small and cramped.

This is a medical room with a very old dirty and non-descript wooden chair in the middle.

Next to the chair you see a dirty bucket. It has a layer of dirty, grime, and thick black blood.

You know anything you put in this bucket will be immediately tainted. If you were able to *pick* the bucket up

and clean it under water you feel you could use it for good.

There is a door to your north and a door to your south. To your south you hear the sound of running water,

the northern door feels like there is a sickly glow imminating from the room.

The medical chair sits in the center of the room, nondescript as ever. The bucket beside it looks like it can be moved.

There is a door to your north and a door to your south. To your south you hear the sound of running water,

the northern door feels like there is a sickly glow imminating from the room.

The medical chair sits in the center of the room.

There is a door to your north and a door to your south. To your south you hear the sound of running water,

the northern door feels like there is a sickly glow imminating from the room.
