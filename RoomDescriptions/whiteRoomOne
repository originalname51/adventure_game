The room is immense and seems to go on forever. Upon further inspection, the walls and ceiling seem to be covered in some reflective material. Through cracks in the ceiling, slits of sunlight bathe the floor in light spilling across an roughly hewn floor. The cracks in the floor seem to scatter light everywhere. Upon a strange looking mound in the center of the room is a very reflective object.

The walls and ceiling of the room are reflective. There is a strange circular hole in one of the walls. There is a discus-shaped object on the floor that you could potentially USE.

Everything in the room begins shaking. A portion of the floor crumbles falling to a level below. Glimpes of the top of a wooden ladder protrude through the newly formed hole.
